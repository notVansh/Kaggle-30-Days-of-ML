# Introduction
In Lesson 1 (Introduction), you’ll learn more about what the course covers.

# Missing Values
Most machine learning libraries (including scikit-learn) give an error if you try to build a model using data with missing values. In Lesson 2 (Missing Values), you’ll learn about three different approaches for dealing with missing values in your data.

# Categorical Variables
A categorical variable is a variable that takes only a limited number of values, and it’s common to encounter them in data. Learn how to work with them in Lesson 3 (Categorical Variables).
