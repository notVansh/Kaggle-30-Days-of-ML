# Lists
Lists in Python represent ordered sequences of values. Here is an example of how to create them:

```primes = [2, 3, 5, 7]```

# Loops
Loops are a way to repeatedly execute some code.

# List comprehensions
List comprehensions are one of Python's most beloved and unique features. The easiest way to understand them is probably to just look at a few examples:

```squares = [n**2 for n in range(10)]
squares```
```[0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81]```
